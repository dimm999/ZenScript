ZenScript
Where Focus Meets Aesthetics.
ZenScript is a beautiful, minimalist, block-based text editor designed to help you enter a deep state of flow. Inspired by the elegance of tools like Zen Mode, Scrivener, and Notion, it combines powerful document organization with a soothing, distraction-free writing environment.
Whether you are drafting a novel, organizing daily notes, or structuring a complex project, ZenScript gets out of your way so your ideas can take center stage.

✨ Key Features
🍃 Distraction-Free Writing

Typographic Excellence: Choose from carefully curated fonts (Inter, Merriweather, JetBrains Mono, or Handwritten) and adjust sizing for optimal readability.
Aesthetic Themes: Switch between soothing color palettes like Soda Light, Wonder Ink, Writer's Study, Midnight, and Classic Zen to match your mood and reduce eye strain.
